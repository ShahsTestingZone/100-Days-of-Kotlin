# 100 Days Of Code (Kotlin) - Log

### Day 5: November 20th, 2021 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Yesterday I forgot to update the repo but I have now added the update. Today I completed Lesson 2.2 
I extended the AboutMe app to add user interaction. I added a nickname field, a DONE button, and a text view to display the nickname. 
Once the user enters a nickname and taps the DONE button, 
Now the text view updates to show the entered nickname. 


### Day 4: November 19th, 2021 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I completed Lesson 2.1 which is a section on 'Linear layout using the Layout Editor'. I learnt about storing different Resources Values within
res>values folder e.g. dimensions, style and how to use the scrollable feature within a view.
The project i worked on this section is called 'About Me'.
  

### Day 3: November 18th, 2021 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I completed the remaining sections in Lesson 1: Build your first app. I went over basic app anatomy, layouts, image resources and compatibility. 

I created 2 basic apps using simple code logic; Dice Roller and another app using the Basic Template.

Having done android before, the course hasn't gone into anything new but i do like the refresher on layouts and understanding better code solutions to challenges given in the course.  


### Day 2: November 17th, 2021 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Spent some time today building out my github profile and learning how to using Github and Github Desktop. This has given me a peace of mind as i am able to track my progress better on github. 

I also started the Android Kotlin Fundamentals Course, completing Lessons 1.0 and 1.1.

### Day 1: November 16th, 2021 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Set up github account, created a repo and went on developers.android to review the course content for Android Kotlin Fundamentals.

In terms of my baseline, i have already done a extensive online course and have some knowledge of Android/Kotlin. The course was created in 2019 and currently outdated hence the refresher to go over some of the new libraries and ways of doing things.
