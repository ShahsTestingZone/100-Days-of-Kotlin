# 100 Days Of Code (Kotlin) - Log


### Day 3: November 18th, 2021 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Today I completed the remaining sections in Lesson 1: Build your first app. I went over basic app anatomy, layouts, image resources and compatibility. 

I created 2 basic apps using simple code logic; Dice Roller and another app using the Basic Template.

Having done android before, the course hasn't gone into anything new but i do like the refresher on layouts and understanding better code solutions to challenges given in the course.  


### Day 2: November 17th, 2021 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Spent some time today building out my github profile and learning how to using Github and Github Desktop. This has given me a peace of mind as i am able to track my progress better on github. 

I also started the Android Kotlin Fundamentals Course, completing Lessons 1.0 and 1.1.

### Day 0: November 16th, 2021 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Set up github account, created a repo and went on developers.android to review the course content for Android Kotlin Fundamentals.

In terms of my baseline, i have already done a extensive online course and have some knowledge of Android/Kotlin. The course was created in 2019 and currently outdated hence the refresher to go over some of the new libraries and ways of doing things.
