/*
* Sometimes the key names in a JSON response can make confusing Kotlin properties, or may not match your coding styleâ€”for example, in the JSON file the img_src key uses an underscore,
* whereas Kotlin properties commonly use upper and lowercase letters ("camel case").
*
* To use variable names in your data class that differ from the key names in the JSON response, use the @Json annotation.
* In this example, the name of the variable in the data class is imgSrcUrl.
* The variable is mapped to the JSON attribute img_src using @Json(name = "img_src").
