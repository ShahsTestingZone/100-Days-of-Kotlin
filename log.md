# 100 Days Of Code (Kotlin) - Log

### Day 0: November 16th, 2021 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Set up github account, created a repo and went on developers.android to review the course content for Android Kotlin Fundamentals.

In terms of my baseline, i have already done a extensive online course and have some knowledge of Android/Kotlin. The course was created in 2019 and currently outdated hence the refresher to go over some of the new libraries and ways of doing things.
