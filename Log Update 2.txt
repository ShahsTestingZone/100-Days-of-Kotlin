### Day 35: January 14th 2022 ()

**Today's Progress**:
Today i worked on 'Unit2: Layouts'. I updated the Tipping Calculator App and carried the code labs on from yesterday. 

I looked at concepts such as 
- Material Design - Updating Theme to used more polished designs e.g switches, edit textfields(outlined)
- Using 'TalkBack' to look at the accessibility implementation of the app
- Wrote basic instrumentation Tests using Junit and Expresso Library

I also relearnt how to use intelliJ - it took 1.5 hours to set up the environment and familiarise myself with it again.

### Day 34: January 4th 2022 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**:
Today i worked on 'Unit2: Layouts'. 
This training codelab was really useful for implementing material design concepts. This section was more practical than the previous course.  
You really had to get into the code by using the XML for implementing the theme and style of the app.  

Useful Feature - Format number into a currency based on the locale setting on someones phone. 
val formattedNumber: String = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance.format(Int)
